# Building better discipline.

How do you build better discipline? Routines are a great place to start building better Discipline.

Trust me, I'm a military kid who spent time in Kakinada.

Awesome.

Building routines is simple, just add a fixed time to 1 activity you do in the day. For example, wake up at 0600.

Sleep on time, put your alarm for 0600 and just sleep for 8 hours. Easy enough?

It's okay if it's not. Phone alarms never woke me up, so I got a physical alarm clock with Arabic numbers. Confused the shit out of me in the morning.

I can one up that. Simple bet, if I don't post this file "discipline.md" on my GitHub by 0600 on 20th January 2024 IST, i will have to post the file i wrote before that, [[introToPysch101]] on the 21st of Jan, 2024.

nice, simple bet.

if you can't go on the internet, find my GitHub and find this complete file there by 0600 tomorrow, you lose. You just have to wake up at 0600 in your timezone.

You realise how confusing that is for an alarm clock right?

Instead of just sleeping on time, you now have to go on the internet, look for a stranger's GitHub and figure out if he lied or didn't a couple years after he actually lied.

you do realise how overly-complicated it is even as an idea.

good. thank you!

### "so... you're just re-writing The Subtle Art of not Giving a F###"
no, i'm not. I'm rewriting the last book that guy wrote.

First off, the subtle art of not giving a fuck gave so many fucks i lost count. it did NOT sell as many copies as it did without giving a fuck ton of fucks.

it just gave the right fucks.

which is fucking easy by the way.

# The Art of Writing.
# sorry, fuck the art.

we tried the art thing, it genuinely didn't work. we need more discipline in our lives.

because it's just easier.

you really shouldn't have to be able to see the pattern to appreciate it.

discipline is a dream to the people who can't achieve it.

chtnnh.
